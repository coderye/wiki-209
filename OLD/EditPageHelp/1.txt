A list of the most common formatting rules. There also is a complete list at [TextFormattingRules].
{{{
(empty line)     Make a paragraph break. 
----             Horizontal ruler
[link]           Create hyperlink to "link", where "link" can be either an internal 
                 WikiName or an external link (http://)
[text|link]      Create a hyperlink where the link text is different from the actual 
                 hyperlink link.
[link#heading]   Jumps to that heading on the page.  The heading here needs to be 
                 written in CamelCase.
[text|wiki:link] Create a hyperlink where the link text is different from the 
                 actual hyperlink link, and the hyperlink points to a named Wiki. 
                 This supports interWiki linking.

*                Make a bulleted list (must be in first column). Use more (**)
                 for deeper indentations.
#                Make a numbered list (must be in first column). Use more (##, ###) 
                 for deeper indentations.

!, !!, !!!       Start a line with an exclamation mark (!) to make a heading. 
                 More exclamation marks mean bigger headings.

__text__         Makes text bold.
''text''         Makes text in italics (notice that these are single quotes ('))
{{text}}         Makes text in monospaced font.
;term:def        Defines 'term' with 'def'.  Use this with empty 'term' to 
                  make short comments.
\\               Forced line break (please use sparingly).


}}}              

Don't use HTML, it doesn't work.

If you want to use images on your page, simply use a wikilink, like ~[myImage.png~], save the page, and attache the image to the page (of cours with the exact same page).
You can find the list of approved formats, on the [SystemInfo] page.

To make a code block, use triple {'s to open, and triple }'s to close.

If you want to use square brackets ({{[[]}}) in the page without creating a hyperlink, use two opening square brackets. So the text {{[[[Example Non-Link]}}, will appear as {{[[Example Non-Link]}}.
